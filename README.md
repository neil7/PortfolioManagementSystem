# PortfolioManagementSystem
This system allows everyone to go into our application and have a look on the current set of stocks with a view whether to buy, sell or hold. This is calculated using votes given by the authorised users. In order to vote for a stock, a person needs to register on the system. Once registered, a user is authorised to buy, sell, mark stock as favourite or give opinion (vote) about any stock. Our system uses stock data as stored in the database with pre-defined quantity.
